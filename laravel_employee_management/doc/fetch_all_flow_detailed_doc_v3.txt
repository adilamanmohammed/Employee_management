Step-by-Step Explanation with File References:

1. User Interaction:
   - What: User clicks the "Fetch All Employees" button on the manage employees page.
   - Why: To retrieve the list of all employees from the system.
   - How: The UI triggers a JavaScript event.
   - File: `resources/views/employees/manage.blade.php` (jQuery event listener attached to the button triggers AJAX call)

2. Frontend AJAX Call:
   - What: JavaScript (jQuery AJAX) sends a GET request to the backend endpoint `/employees/fetch-all-action`.
   - Why: AJAX allows asynchronous data fetching without reloading the page, improving user experience.
   - How: jQuery's $.ajax method is used with the URL and success/error callbacks defined in the JavaScript code within the Blade template.
   - File: `resources/views/employees/manage.blade.php` (JavaScript AJAX call implementation)

3. Laravel Route:
   - What: The route defined in `routes/web.php` listens for GET requests at `/employees/fetch-all-action`.
   - Why: Routes map URLs to specific controller methods, organizing request handling.
   - How: Laravel's Route::get method is used to define the route.
   - File: `routes/web.php`

4. Controller Method:
   - What: The `fetchAllAction` method in `EmployeeController` is invoked.
   - Why: Controllers handle business logic and coordinate between models and views.
   - How: The method queries the database using the Employee model and returns a JSON response with the data.
   - File: `app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php`

5. Model Query:
   - What: The Employee model's `all()` method retrieves all records from the `employees` table.
   - Why: Eloquent ORM abstracts database queries, making data access easier and more secure.
   - How: `Employee::all()` returns a collection of Employee objects representing each row in the table.
   - File: `app/Models/Employee.php`

6. Database:
   - What: The query fetches data from the `employees` table in the database.
   - Why: The database stores persistent employee data.
   - How: Laravel uses PDO or SQL Server drivers to communicate with the database and execute the query.
   - File: Database server (external to project files)

7. JSON Response:
   - What: The controller returns the employee data as a JSON response.
   - Why: JSON is a lightweight data format easily consumed by JavaScript on the frontend.
   - How: Laravel's `response()->json()` method formats the data and sends it back to the AJAX call.
   - File: `app/Http/Controllers/EmployeeController.php`

8. Frontend UI Update:
   - What: The frontend JavaScript receives the JSON data and dynamically renders it in an HTML table.
   - Why: To display the employee list to the user without a full page reload.
   - How: jQuery manipulates the DOM to insert table rows with employee data, updating the UI dynamically.
   - File: `resources/views/employees/manage.blade.php`

This detailed flow with file references helps new developers understand how frontend and backend components interact in a Laravel + jQuery application to implement a common feature.
