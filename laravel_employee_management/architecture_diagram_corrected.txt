Description:
- Frontend UI interacts with users and sends AJAX requests.
- Routes map URLs to controller methods.
- Controller handles requests, validates data, and interacts with the model.
- Model represents the database table and performs ORM operations.
- Database stores employee data.

This corrected architecture follows Laravel best practices and ensures clear separation of concerns for maintainability and scalability.
